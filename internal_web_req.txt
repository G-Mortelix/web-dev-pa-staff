mhm this is pretty much the overall functions, but ill explain a bit more to clarify

its an internal website, have two types of user: admin and user

for master admin: 
- register new user and admin, and delete or edit them
- add/delete/edit permission for user
- add/delete dept
- add/delete/edit folders

for admin:
- can manage the add/edit/delete folder and add/delete pdf files
- register new user, delete or edit existing user
- add/delete/edit permission for user
- add/delete dept
- add/delete/edit folders
- see all the dept files and folders

for users:
- each users, restricted to only see the files and folders of their own department/dept tht they associated with. example: useracct can access folders from accounting dept and from general dept.
- general dept is open to all users regardless of their dept 
- each users, have default permission to read the files in their dept
- users with permissions can upload files into the folder of their dept, and delete the file from folder of their dept
- permissions that are managed by admin for the user are: upload file and delete file. these r not mutually exclusive, meaning one user can have both permission, or either one of them, or none at all, for users with no permissions, they will follow the default permission - read file
- rn, the relationship between users and depts are many to many. so one user can have at max 4 dept associated with
